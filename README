If you want to use this program as a stand-alone, run it from irb. 

A board is represented by an array of arrays.
Each mini-array represents a tile.
Example: [[tile_location, roll_value, resource],...,[tile_location19, roll_value19, resource19]

The harbors are contained separately in a one-dimensional array. 
The location of a harbor is determined by its position in the array.
